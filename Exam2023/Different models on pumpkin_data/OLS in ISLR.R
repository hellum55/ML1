# i) Yes, there is a relatioship between the predictors and the response by testing
#the null hypothesis of whether all the regression coefficients are zero. The F
#-statistic is far from 1 (with a small p-value), indicating evidence against
#the null hypothesis.
# ii) displacement, weigh, year, origin have a significant relationship when looking at their t-statistic.
