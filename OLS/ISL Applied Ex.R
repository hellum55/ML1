    # "mpg" stands for miles per gallon, and is used to show how far your car is able 
    # to travel for every gallon (4.55 litres) of fuel it uses. 
    # As an example, if you own a car that can return 50 mpg and its fuel tank only 
    # has 1 gallon of petrol or diesel in it, you should be able to drive 50 miles 
    # before the car runs out of fuel.

      # i) Is there a relationship? 
            # - Look at F-statistic + its p-value and then to the individual 
            #   p-values associated with the predictors
            # - Both are highly significant evidence of a possible association
         
      # ii) How strong is the relationship? 
            # - beta = -0.157845 meaning that 1 unit increase in horsepower 
            #   is associted with an average decrease in miles per gallon by around 0.15
            # - Look at R-squared (in SLR is equal to corr coef. squared): 
            #   the % of variance explained in the response is 0.6059 - quite high. 
            # - in MLR, check Adjusted R-squared which adjusts the statistic based on 
            #   the number of independent variables in the model 
            
            # - Look at RSE (4.906). RSE is considered a measure of the lack of fit of 
            #   the model to the data 
            # - In other words, the actual miles per gallon deviate from the true regression 
            #   line by approx. 4.91 miles on average. 
            # - Is this an acceptable prediction error? It depends on the context. 
            #   In our dataset, the mean value of mile per gallon (mpg) for the cars is 23.44
            #   Dividing RSE by the mean value for the response (23.44) indicates a percentage 
            #   error of roughly 21%.
            # 
      # iii) Direction or sign of the relationship 
            # - There is a negative asssociation. Horsepower is negatively asssocited with mpg.
         
      # vi) 95%CI for the coeficients
            confint(lm.fit, level=0.95)
            
      # iv) Predicted value of y if x = 98
            predict (lm.fit, data.frame(horsepower = 98), interval="confidence")
            predict (lm.fit, data.frame(horsepower = 98), interval="prediction")
            # - both intervals are centered at 24.4678. 
            # - Confidence interval is narrower because it reflects the uncertainty 
            #   surrounding the average mpg of all vehicles with a horsepower of 98
            # - Prediction interval is substantially wider because it reflects the uncertainty 
            #   surrounding a particular vehicle 
            # - Prediction 95% CI  for x=98 goes from 14.8 to 34.12 mpg
            # - We interpret the CI saying that 95% of intervals of this form, will contain 
            #   the true value of Y

            #            transformation of the predictor, X.
            # 2) Plot 2: the residuals exhibit some deviation from normal distribution 
                         # Solution: Explore and exclude the problematic observations; 
            #            or tranform X.  
            # 3) Plot 3: the residuals exhibit some "funel shape" distribution: The magnitude 
            #            of residuals tend to increase with fitted values. Non-constant variance.
            #            Solution: Check specific outliers, tranform Y using log or square-root, 
            #            re-run the regression.
